For this assignment, I wrote a Python script that analyzed the financial records in the provided budget_data.csv file. This script successfully reads through the file and calculates the total number of months, net total amount of "Profits/Losses", changes in "Profit/Losses" and average of those changes, greatest increase in profits (date/amount), and greatest decrease in profits (date/amount) over the entire period. This script prints the financial analysis to the terminal and also exports the same analysis to a new text file. 
</p>

<p>
In order to complete this script, I used the csv module to read and write file contents, the os module to specify their file paths, and demonstrated my knowledge of variables, lists/list comprehensions, dictionaries/dictionary comprehensions, print statements, detailed commenting, and general Python syntax.
